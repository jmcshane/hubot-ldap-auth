= Hubot LDAP Authorization

This module is derived from the middleware concept within Hubot in order to use LDAP groups to manage authentication for the calls to Hubot commands.  This allows authorization details for specific actions to be drawn from an externally managed repository.  It is designed specifically for enterprise integrations that require validation against active directory or other LDAP compatible systems.
